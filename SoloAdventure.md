## Need-To-Knows

This section will tell you a bit of the background of this adventure, read through all of them to add to your enjoyment of the adventure.

### The Carvers

They are a species of sapient rats and mices. Generally standing about 3 to 4 feet tall. Originally they are enslaved by the Dwarves of the Undermountain to dig through the subterranean tunnels of theirs and build their hallowed Stonehalls. They have since rebelled against their slavers. After freeing themselves, they set their eyes on the surface world and aim to conquer it, the way their dwarven slavers did to them.

The Carvers are expert burrowers, solid ground treated like swimming water for the most skilled of them. Relying on their numbers, due to their propensity of quick reproduction, they have amassed a large army of rodents, ready to take on the surface world. Their pack tactics are deadly. Just one Carver might not be a problem, but if there is one, then there is 10 not far from that one.

### The Knights of Splendor

Duke Frederick Orthonais III has established the order of the Knights of Splendor, upon three generations of the duchy. They were simply man-at-arms skilled enough in the arts of warfare, lifted by the duke himself into the order.

The name of Splendor is taken by the duke to signify that the knights weren't bred into nobility, but are made from common men with their skills polished. Nowadays, the order takes hopefuls from all casts of life. The only absolute requirement is that they have to be a citizen of the duchy. Squires are not assigned knights on induction, rather they are brought into training under several Knight-Tutor. The training is known to be harsh that most squires gives up before they are given the rank of Knight-Novice.

## Adventure Starts Here

The Knights of Splendor has been fighting the Carvers' scourge into the duchy. They have established a line of defense well into the south of the border town of Velorum. However, they are running out of supplies and fighting arms. They have hired several caravans from Velorum to move supplies from neighboring towns and villages. You, an adventurer has been hired by the Knights of Splendor to escort the caravan into the frontlines.

Due to the increased activity of the knights near Velorum, it is not expected that there would be any bandits dared to raid the caravan, therefore, you alone is hired to escort this one particular caravan. The perceived dangers is low, and you are expected to complete this straightforward job from the order, or at least that is how it's supposed to be.

After preparing yourself for rations and equipment for the 1-day journey ahead, you head to the place where the caravan is parked. It is the stable near the southern town gate. There, you see the caravan. It is currently being packed with the goods its supposed to deliver. You may make an Intelligence check to Recall Knowledge against a CR of 14 on the goods that's being packed. On a success, go to E001 and back here.

Overseeing the loading procedure is a man with blonde hair, wearing a breastplate. He bears the Knight-Novice emblem from the order. As you approach, he notices you.

"Ah, well met. You must be the adventurer we hired to escort the caravan." As he turn to look at you.

"My name is Cashal. I shall be in charge of the caravan. I trust that you are able to secure the caravan, yes?" He throws you a concerned look. You reply with a simple nod. You have been in several caravan escort job before. This should be nothing new.

"Ah, you need not worry. I do not foresee any dangers in our journey to the front lines." How strange. Usually the coaches of the caravan does worry, if they need to hire an escort at all. You may make a Wisdom check for Insight against a CR of 13. On a success go o E002 and then back here.

"We are done loading the goods. We should depart immediately, the frontlines desperately needs these cargos delivered" Without much complain, you agreed and hop on the caravan.

## The Road

Knight-Novice Cashal is partly right about the job. The open road to the frontline has been peaceful. The road leads into a forest. The green pines greets you as you enter from the wide plains next to Velorum. As you enter the forest, Knight-Novice Cashal gets visibly more nervous. It could make sense, there are a lot of ambush point in a forest. He is a novice after all, being assigned to such an important task can get to anyone's nerves.

After a while of trodding the forest path, your progress is impeded by a fallen trunk of tree. Circling it is not an option, since the path is sandwiched by a thick vegetation that caravan can't pass.

You may make an Investigation check using INT against a CR of 12. On a success, go to B004, then return here.

"This is unfortunate" Says Cashal. "We could summon a carpenter from Velorum, but they will take half a day reaching this point, and someone needs to escort them as well." He continues.

Knight-Novice Cashal looks back on the path you came from. 

"I think I saw another path back there. A bit hidden by the some bushes. Perhaps that leads out of this forest. A small detour, but it shall be better than waiting around for half a day. What say you?" He continues.

You take a look at the trunk, perhaps you can somehow destroy it, just enough so that the caravan can pass. Or maybe some other way to get rid of the tree trunks?

You can try lifting the tree trunk with an Athletics check using STR against a CR of 20

You can also try destroying the tree trunk. If you have a weapon that can cut the trunk or burn it, you may make an attack roll against a GRD of 18. You need to reach a damage amount of 10 in one roll, otherwise you fail.

You may also try for a Remote Manipulation invocation. The CR of this is 20.

If any of those three attempts succeeds, go visit B005, then back here. If you failed or cannot do any of the above, go visit B006 and back here.

## The Deep Forest

The forest gets a bit more darker as your caravan journeys deeper. The sunlight struggles to get in between the thick canopy over your head. Trickles of light that does breaks free feebly guides your way as you progress deeper. 

You grow more cautious as you go. Though it is hard, since the darkness of the forest hides many unseen dangers.

You may make a Perception check with WIS with a CR of 15. On a success go to C007.

As the journey goes by, you begin to feel unease. A gut feeling from many adventures that you had. Something is not right. You feel that it's prudent to finally confront Cashal about this hunch you've been nursing.

You ask Cashal about the strange occasion that he know of the alternative path, when you didn't see it. You ask how strange is it that he knows the journey will be uneventful.

Make a Persuasion check with CHA against a CR of 18. If you have visited A002, A003, C007, B004 you may add +1 circumstance bonus for each, you may also make an Intimidation check with CHA instead, if you've at least visited one of the four resolutions. On a success, go to C008, on a fail go to C009.

## Carvers' Ambush

Black shadows jumps from the margins of the dark pathway of the forest. One by one the weak sunlight reveals each carvers standing on the road, armed and the least friendly. You count 8 of them coming your way.

If you have been to B005, then they are waylaid by finding you. There are only 5 Carvers.

If you have visited C008, Cashal fights alongside you. If not, he is also your enemy.

Half of the Carvers should be knaves and the other half is a boltsman. Lean on knaves if the number of Carvers are odd

There are two ways of running this combat encounter. If you do not want to set up a battlemap, you may use the Theatre of Mind way of doing it. If you have the time to set it, you may use the battlemap.

The combat ends in two ways. If you have no friendly characters left conscious, the game is over. You may restart the adventure. If all Carvers are defeated with at least 1 friendly character conscious, you win the encounter.

### Theatre of Mind

You can measure range with one point of reference, the Caravan. All Carvers starts 30ft from the caravan, while you and Cashal are 10ft from the Caravan. Creatures that are on the same range to the Caravan and not in melee with each other are 15ft to each other.

If you have visited C008, for each creature's turn, they may spend 1 AP to move to a cover. Their range doesn't change, but their guard is added with +3 bonus. Their cover is destroyed if they are victim to a successful attack. Any creature may also route a covered creature by spending 1 AP. At which point the attack against the previously covered creature targets a normal GRD defense.

### Battlemap
[TODO]

## After Ambush

If you resolved the combat encounter in less than 3 rounds, you may make a Perception check with WIS against a CR of 15. On a success go to D010

## Resolutions

This section is meant to contain the resolution of your choices, rolls, and path taken in your adventure. While going through the adventure, sometimes they will refer to entries in this section.

### A001 The Knight's Goods

Most of the goods being loaded into the caravan are mundane, rations and weaponries, like your job description mentioned. However, one marked crate caught your attention. It has the Mark of Importance. The mark is used by the Knights of Splendor to denote vital goods on delivery.

### A002 Cashal's Hidden Intent

Cashal shows telltale of deception. You are not sure why he need to ensure you of safe journey at all. One thing is for sure, there will be dangers along the way, however, you have not enough evidence to confront him yet. If you have the Detect Thoughts ability and can invoke it without spectacle, you may use it against Cashal's SAN of 13. On a hit, go to E003

### A003 Detecting Cashal's Thought

"Safe for me at least. I am sorry, adventurer, this is just not your day" His own voice echoes in your mind as you dive into his. Return to the narrative.

### B004 Investigating the Fallen Trunk

Looking to the side of the path where the tree used to grow, you can see the stump. The tree is still healthy. Its bark is fresh and did not rot. There is no sign of lichen or fungi as well, denoting that the tree has fallen recently. Looking at the stump, it seems that the tree did not fall naturally, but is cut by someone.

### B005 Fallen Trunk Removed

With the obstacle removed, your progress can continue. You look over at Knight-Novice Cashal. After a momentary awe, you can see that he cringes a bit, followed by a bullet of sweat running down his temple.

Knight-Novice Cashal then invites you to hop back into the caravan before continuing the journey.

### B006 Failed Removing Fallen Trunk

Despite your best attempts, or none thereof, you cannot remove the tree trunk. You walk back to your caravan. You can see that Knight-Novice Cashal breathed a sigh of relief, before maintaining his composure.

Knight-Novice Cashal then invites you to hop back into the caravan before continuing the journey. He turns the caravan around to look for the alternative path, which is not far from where you are.

The path is indeed hidden by an overgrown bush, but the path beyond is clear. You and Cashal takes the path.

### C007 Carvers Footprints

You find a set of Carvers footprints on the ground. They are recent, but it's unclear how recent. What is clear that you are sure that there are a group of Carvers nearby.

### C008 Successfully Confronting Cashal

You brought up all the facts you have encountered along the journey. Everything that has been bugging you is now out in the air. In response, Cashal stops the caravan. You see that his grip on the horse's reins tightens, as he stares downward into the ground. He might as well stare deep into his own conscience.

"A sharp one, you are. . ." Cashal begins to speak. His voice trembles, as if the facts you presented has shattered his own confidence.

"There will be an ambush, not far from here. It does not matter that we stop here, the Carvers will come if they wait too long." His face turns grim.

"I realize that I owe you an explanation, however. . . we do not have time to do so. If you want to live, we should mount up a defense" He said as he hops off the caravan. He immediately unloads many of the caravan crates and barrels and starts putting them around the caravan. You help him doing so.

"I know some of them carry crossbows. These will grant us covers from their hail of bolts." He observes the placement carefully.

"I am afraid this will do nothing for their melee approach. That, we will have to defend ourself." He unsheathes his longsword from his scabbard.

"They are coming. Steel your wit!"

Go back to the main adventure branch.

### C009 Failed in Confronting Cashal

You brought up all the facts you have encountered along the journey. Everything that has been bugging you is now out in the air. In response, Cashal stares at you with a strange look.

"I-I do not know what you are talking about" He stammers. "It is all just an unfortunate coincidence. This, I swear. . ."

The caravan continues, until. . .

Return the main adventure branch

### D010 Witnessed A Carver Thief

You see a Carver cunningly sneaks into the caravan and lifted one particular crate from inside. The crate is marked. Refer to A001 for what the crate is if you have been there.

If you can do a ranged attack, you may make one against the Carver's GRD. On a hit, you kill the Carver and they dropped the crate into the ground.
