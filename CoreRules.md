# Amalgam RPG

Embark on an adventure in a homebrewed Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) that blends the ease of adaptability to any setting with a touch of familiarity for enthusiasts of mainstream RPGs. This game is meticulously designed to streamline complex mechanics prevalent in other games, shifting the focus towards enriching character development and options.

## Method of Action Resolution

In this game, the crux of determining the outcome of actions lies in a simple yet dynamic game. Players roll three six-sided dice (3d6) as the foundation for generating a random result. To this number, players add relevant modifiers—derived from their character's abilities, skills, or situational advantages—to calculate the total score. This score is then compared to a Challenge Rating (CR), a threshold set by the Game Master (GM) representing the difficulty of the attempted action. Surpassing the CR signifies a successful action.

A unique twist in the game is the "Success with a Twist" mechanic. Should any of the dice roll a six, players have the option to choose this route. Here, while the action is successful, it introduces unforeseen complications or interesting narrative turns, adding depth and unpredictability to the story.

## Character Creation

Creating character is simple and streamlined. Players need to assign their attribute scores, and take features to round up their characters.

### Attributes

The game uses six base attributes :

|Attribute Name|Description|
|---|---|
| Strength | 	This attribute signifies a character's physical power, muscle, and overall bodily strength.   |
| Dexterity | Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and precision, reflecting how skillful a character is in physical tasks requiring finesse.  |
| Constitution | A gauge of a character's resilience, endurance, and health, Constitution indicates how well they withstand physical challenges, illnesses, and harsh conditions.   |
| Intelligence | Intelligence encompasses mental acuity, knowledge, and reasoning abilities, reflecting how well a character learns, remembers, and solves problems.   |
| Wisdom | This attribute represents a character's perceptiveness, intuition, and attunement to their surroundings, crucial for insight and understanding beyond mere intellect.   |
| Charisma | Charisma is the measure of a character's social skills, charm, and ability to influence others, playing a key role in interactions and negotiations.  |

These attributes form the backbone of your character, influencing their interactions, skills, and how they navigate the challenges of the game world. As you assign these scores, consider how they reflect your character's background, strengths, and weaknesses, crafting a persona that is as unique as your adventure.

### Assigning Attributes

In the creation of a new character, players are allocated a pool of 8 points to distribute among their attributes. This allocation is straightforward: assigning a value of 4 to Strength, for example, means 4 points from this pool are dedicated to that attribute.

The value in each attribute not only defines a character's innate abilities but also contributes to the outcome of actions. When a roll involves a specific attribute, its score is added as a modifier, enhancing the chances of success.

For characters starting at level 1, the maximum score for any attribute is capped at 4. As characters progress, this cap increases, rising by 1 at levels 3, 6, 8, and 10, allowing for continued growth and development.

### Hit Points

Calculate your Hit Points using the following formula :

HP = 10 + (CON x 3) 

HP is the measure of how long your character can stay up in combat. When it reaches 0, your character is unconscious or otherwise unable to participate further in combat.

### Extraordinary Points

Calculate your Extraordinary Points using the following formula :

EP : 10 + (LINK x 3)

EP is the measure of how many times you can do your extraordinary powers that's linked to your attribute. You don't need this resource if you do not have Extraordinary Capabilities Feature

### Defenses

These values represents your measure of resistance against various incoming attacks that would harm you.

Guard: This is calculated as 10 plus the sum of Strength and Dexterity. Guard reflects your character's ability to dodge or deflect physically avoidable attacks.

Resilience: Calculated as 10 plus the sum of Constitution and Charisma, this defense measures your character's toughness against attacks that are either unavoidable or penetrate through armor.

Sanity: Sanity, determined as 10 plus the sum of Intelligence and Wisdom, represents your mental fortitude against assaults on the mind.

### Character Features

The game revolves around Character Features for powercreep. A level 1 character gets 12 Feature Points to spend on Features. Each level up grants them 6 Feature Points.

Refer to the Features list for more information on each features.

### Extraordinary Capabilities

The progression and power dynamics in the game are centered on Character Features. At level 1, each character is granted 12 Feature Points to invest in various Features. With each level gained, an additional 6 Feature Points are awarded.

For detailed descriptions and options for these Features, players should refer to the provided Features list. This list serves as a guide to customizing and enhancing your character's abilities, skills, and unique qualities.

## Playing the Game

### Using your Attributes

Your character's attributes, as outlined in the character creation process, embody various qualities and skills they possess. When confronted with a challenge, the Game Master (GM) will inquire about your approach to resolving it. This is your opportunity to leverage your attributes, employing their strengths to overcome obstacles and drive the narrative forward.

#### Strength
Strength is pivotal for challenges that demand physical power and muscular effort. Utilizing this attribute, your character can engage in tasks like:

**Lifting Heavy Objects**: Whether it’s hoisting a large crate or moving a boulder, Strength is key in situations requiring brute force.
**Jumping**: Leaping across gaps or reaching higher platforms often requires a significant amount of leg power, falling under the purview of Strength.
**Physical Combat**: In melee battles, Strength determines the power behind each blow, making it crucial for warriors and anyone engaging in hand-to-hand combat.

#### Dexterity
Dexterity comes into play when tasks require precision, agility, or coordination. Examples include:

**Stealth**: Moving silently and unnoticed, perfect for sneaking past guards or avoiding detection.
**Acrobatics**: Performing agile maneuvers, balancing, or swiftly navigating through tricky terrain.
**Ranged Attacks**: Aiming and shooting with accuracy, whether it’s with a bow, a thrown weapon, or any other ranged implement.

#### Constitution
Constitution is key in enduring physical hardships and maintaining stamina. It's essential for:

**Resisting Toxins**: Overcoming the effects of poisons or harmful substances.
**Enduring Harsh Conditions**: Withstanding extreme weather, enduring long marches, or surviving in hostile environments.
**Sustaining Effort**: Engaging in prolonged physical activity without succumbing to fatigue.

#### Intelligence
Intelligence is crucial for challenges involving reasoning, knowledge, and memory. Situations where Intelligence is key include:

**Problem-Solving**: Deciphering puzzles, creating strategies, or analyzing complex situations.
**Knowledge Recall**: Remembering or deducing vital information, lore, or arcane mysteries.
**Crafting and Magic Use**: Creating intricate items or casting spells that require mental acuity.

#### Wisdom
Wisdom is used in scenarios requiring insight, intuition, or attunement to the surroundings. It plays a role in:

**Perception**: Noticing hidden details, detecting traps, or discerning illusions.
**Insight into Others**: Gauging motives, predicting behavior, or sensing lies.
**Survival Skills**: Navigating wilderness, tracking creatures, or finding resources in nature.

#### Charisma
Charisma is essential for interactions involving persuasion, leadership, or influence. It's employed in:

**Negotiation**: Convincing others, bartering, or resolving conflicts through dialogue.
**Deception**: Bluffing, disguising true intentions, or spinning tales.
**Inspiring Allies**: Boosting morale, leading groups, or swaying public opinion.

### Extraordinary

You might have the Extraordinary Capabilities feature. Depending on the flavor of your extraordinary powers, you might be able to :

**Control Energy**

Leveraging these attributes effectively allows your character to navigate the myriad challenges they will face, shaping their journey and the unfolding story.

### Combat

Combat unfolds in a dynamic, turn-based sequence. The order of action is fluid, emphasizing strategy and teamwork among players and the game's challenges.

**Turn Order**

Players always initiate combat, with the first player to act setting the stage. Following this, turns alternate between player characters (PCs) and non-player characters (NPCs) controlled by the Game Master (GM). The specific order of action within each group is flexible:

- Player Turns: When it's the players' turn, the group can discuss and decide among themselves who should act next. This allows for strategic planning and coordinated efforts.

- NPC Turns: The GM determines which NPC acts during their turn, adding an element of unpredictability and challenge.

#### Action Points

In combat, Action Points (AP) are a crucial resource. Each PC starts with 3 AP (unless modified by other effects). These points can be spent in various ways during a turn, allowing players to tailor their actions according to the situation.

#### Attacks and Damages

To launch an attack and inflict HP damage, refer to the Basic Combat Abilities for options. The damage potential of an attack is influenced by the weapon or ability used, each having a 'Damage' rating ranging from 1 to 3.

- Making an Attack: Roll 3d6 and add the appropriate attribute modifier, as indicated by the chosen weapon or ability. If both weapon and ability suggest an attribute, use your highest. Compare the total roll against the target's defense (specified by the weapon or ability).

- Calculating Damage: If the attack hits, for damage calculation, retain a number of the highest dice from your roll equal to the 'Damage' rating of your attack. Sum these dice, add the relevant attribute modifier, and the total is the HP damage dealt.

**Damage Rating**

When you deal damage, be it via weapon or other abilities, you will be told the damage rating that you deal against your enemies. Damaging rating ranges from 1/2 to 4

- **Damage 1/2** Means that you keep one lowest dice from the attack roll
- **Damage 1 to 3** Means that you keep equal number of dice as indicated from the attack roll. Sum these dice and add the bonuses you may get.
- **Damage 4** Means that you keep all the dice from the attack roll, or inflict 9 damage if you roll lower than that.

#### Critical Attack

Your attack is a critical when all three of your dice shows the same number. A critical attack always hits, and the damage from the attack is doubled.

#### Multiple Attacks in One Turn

You may make multiple attacks in your turn, provided that you have the APs for them. However, for each additional attacks, you will have to make it with a stacking penalty of -3. If you have another weapon that you have not used to attack, you may ignore the penalty.

For example, if you have a longsword in one hand, your first attack does not get the penalty, but your second attack with the same longsword is made with -3 penalty, if you attack again with the same longsword, it gets -6 penalty.

However, if you have another longsword in the other hand, you may make an attack with that longsword without penalty. Then if you make another attack with either longswords, you get -3 penalty.

#### Reaching 0 Hit Points and Unconsciousness

When you reach 0 HP, your character is Unconscious. They are unable to act and is otherwise unaware of their surroundings. When they are attacked while unconscious, they are subject to a Coup de Grace. Any attack against the creature targets Resilience, if they formerly targets Guard. When the attack hits, the creature must make a Death Save by rolling 3d6 + CON against the amount of damage. On a fail they die. On a success, they stay Unconscious

Unconscious character, due to 0 HP, can be recovered by getting their HP back up to at least 1, no matter how. If they do, and they have not taken their turn in the round, when taking their turn, they only receive 1 AP.

At the end of a combat encounter, all unconscious character are recovered to 1 HP.

#### Recovering from Conditions

Some abilities or some other effects in the game will cause a debilitating condition to be inflicted on a creature. They can recover from this condition by making a 3d6 + CON roll. The number to beat is dictated by the ability or effect that inflicts the condition.

#### Recovering HP and EP

If the party has lost some HP and EP, they can opt to do a short rest. The party can do two short rests per day or session. When they do, they completely recover all lost HP. The party can do a short rest whenever they have at least 10 minutes of peace. In lieu of other effects, this also clears the party of any and all conditions.

If the party had done taking two short rest in the session or day, the next rest they take will be a long rest. Which has the same effect of a short rest with the addition of EP recovery, but it takes at least 8 hours of their day.

## Running the Game

In the heart of this game lies a core philosophy: fun takes precedence over rigid adherence to rules. As the Game Master (GM), you wield the creative power to modify or omit any aspect of the game that doesn't bring enjoyment to your table. Let go of concerns about perfect balance; tabletop role-playing games thrive not on mathematical precision but on the spirit of fairness and shared storytelling.

**Flexibility and Fairness**

When applying the rules, strive always for fairness. This doesn't mean treating every situation with uniformity, but rather ensuring that your decisions and rulings enhance the enjoyment of all players, including yourself. Here are some examples:

- Adapting Challenges: If a rule seems too harsh or lenient, adjust it to better suit the dynamics of your group.
- Encouraging Creativity: Reward players' innovative solutions, even if they bend the typical interpretations of rules.
- Equal Spotlight: Ensure that each player has their moments to shine, regardless of their character's abilities or the player's experience level.

**The GM's Role and Enjoyment**

The role of a GM is multifaceted and, while it carries responsibilities, it also offers its own unique forms of enjoyment. Unlike players who immerse themselves in the roles of their characters, a GM's satisfaction comes from crafting the world and guiding the narrative:

- Storytelling: Take joy in weaving intricate tales and seeing how players interact with the narrative fabric you create.
- Challenge Design: Delight in constructing encounters and puzzles that are engaging, yet surmountable.
- Character Roleplay: Relish in portraying a diverse cast of characters, each with their own quirks and motives.
- Narrative Twists: Experience the thrill of introducing plot twists and seeing players' reactions.

If the prospect of creating worlds, shaping stories, and guiding adventures excites you, then the role of the GM is calling. This section will offer guidance and tips on how to construct memorable adventures and craft experiences that resonate with your players. Whether you're planning an epic campaign or a single session, the resources here will help you bring your creative vision to life, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for everyone at the table.

### NPC Stats

While the game does not provide a full bestiary or monster manual, it does provide a way for GMs to easily create their own creature of choice. You may follow the following guide to create your own NPC.

**No need for a full statblock**

Your NPC essentially only rolls, and since the six attributes serves nothing more than being modifier, you may skip them and get straight into bonuses for each actions. However, if you do enjoy creating a full character sheet, nothing stops you from doing so.

**NPC Features**

You generally not need to assign features to the NPC, since you control the modifiers anyway. However, you might want to assign them features that does not grant modifiers, like those that grant interesting effects.

**Freedom of Design**

The following is a table that would help you assign numbers to your NPC. The table is designed with statistics of the dice in mind. Outside of these numbers you are free to add more characteristics to your NPC. Just be sure to stick with the fairness and fun core concept. Can you assign Damage Resistance to Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Slashing for a level 1 NPC? Sure. But is it fair and fun for your party to encounter such NPC when they just started adventuring?

Walking the balance between unique design while being fun and fair is not easy, but it is feasible. If you stick to what this table aims for, it should be easy for you to create a fun encounter for your party.

| NPC Level |   HP/EP  |     Defenses   | Primary Modifier | Secondary Modifier |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
|     1     |  9 - 15  |      8 - 12    |       +3         |        +1          | 
|     2     | 12 - 18  |     10 - 14    |       +3         |        +1          |
|     3     | 14 - 20  |     12 - 16    |       +4         |        +2          | 
|     4     | 16 - 22  |     13 - 17    |       +4         |        +2          | 
|     5     | 18 - 24  |     14 - 18    |       +5         |        +3          |

**Example NPC : Blue Slime**

The concept is that the blue slime is generally a weak monster, but once they get near you, they might be a problem, since they can spew frigid air from the internal core. It also able to bulk up before spewing ice. Apart from that, they are also able to just tackle any hostiles.
